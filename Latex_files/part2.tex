\section{part2}
This is Part1 and it contains some text we can. Let's add some dummy text 
and see if it's displayed when it was imported.

% The \subimport command acts similar to \import command with the only difference
% that it take the path of directories relative to the sub file.
% If you use \import command here, it would be search for directories relative
% to your main .tex file.
\subimport{graphics/}{chatbot.tex}
